## Challenge Description

### Scenario

The marketing department approaches you and asks you for a Black Friday sales countdown to increase conversion rates of bookings.
Please take the following image as an example of how the final result should look like.

### Instructions

Please implement the Countdown in ReactJS by using Typescript (if you want you can start with create-react-app boilerplate or something similar) considering the following requirements:

Consider the following hints when implementing the task:

- Write a pure/stateless component that can be reused for each element of the countdown.
- Write another component that holds the current time on the state and acts as a wrapper for all pure components.
- Use any CSS-in-JS solution to style the countdown as shown in the screenshot.
- Add internationalization for another language of your choice
- Think about reusability and extensibility (adding months to the countdown etc.)
- Write two tests, which prove that your solution works as expected.
